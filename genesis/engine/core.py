"""Composition core of the simulation engine: Systems own Data, Actions bind functions to it, pipelines run them.

A Data subclass follows the conventions of genesis.utils.array_class: a `@qd.data_oriented` class with `qd.Tensor`
fields allocated by `V()`, named with a `State` / `Info` suffix, created empty with its System and filled by its init
Action.

A System is a backend unit the user never names: it is constructed from the scene and declares on its class
the Systems it depends on (Require / Find), the Actions it hands out (@System.action) and the ActionCollections it
receives (@System.action_collection, filled through a @System.protocol). An Engine adds the Systems added by hand, the
Systems the functions registered for its class with @register_system return for the scene, and every System they
require, then resolves the dependencies, runs every build() and freezes the collections. A Pipeline runs one entry
point: a host function or a kernel.

                       counting or offsets belongs in a kernel.

            Invoked:   inside the device loop of the manager, once per iteration or once per participant.
            Runs:      inlined into that loop body, as part of the parallel task of the loop.
            Use for:   small per-element or per-participant work, such as reporting a count or returning the
                       contribution of one element to a reduction.
            Typed as:  InlineAction.

        kind="stage"
            Function:  a @qd.func(requires_top_level=True).
            Invoked:   at the top level of a kernel or graph body.
            Runs:      each of its top-level for-loops becomes a parallel task (a graph node), i.e. one pipeline stage.
            Use for:   work that is parallel over the data of the participant, such as a loop over all its DOFs.
            Typed as:  StageAction.

        Each kind has one valid call site: a host function fails when traced into device code, a stage called inside a
        loop has its top-level loops demoted and loses stage ordering, and an inline function called at top level runs
        as one serial step. The declared kind is therefore checked three times: against the function when the Action is
        created (a @qd.kernel is rejected), against the collection on `+=`, and against the protocol parameter
