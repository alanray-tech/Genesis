"""Project a symmetric 2x2 matrix to its nearest PSD matrix (@qd.func).

Device counterpart of ``make_pd.py``, specialised to the 2x2 block that the
mollified barrier Hessian projects (cgq ``gipc_make_pd<double, 2>``).

cgq reaches this through ``Eigen::SelfAdjointEigenSolver::computeDirect``, which
for 2x2 is itself a closed form: eigenvalues ``tr/2 +- sqrt(((a-c)/2)^2 + b^2)``
and, for the eigenvector, whichever of ``(b, l-a)`` / ``(l-c, b)`` has the larger
norm (Eigen picks by the same comparison, expressed on the trace-shifted
matrix). The transcription below is that closed form. Eigen additionally
normalises by the largest shifted coefficient before taking the root, which
moves results by at most an ulp -- far under the 1e-11 tolerance the golden
assembly comparison uses -- so the scaling step is dropped.
